# Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification tasks

Purpose: Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as “yes/no” or “true/false,” based on a given dataset of independent variables.
Representation: Similar to linear regression, logistic regression uses an equation to represent the relationship between the input features and the output probability. However, 
instead of predicting a continuous value, it predicts the probability of a binary outcome.

Log-Odds and Probability:
The logistic model calculates the log-odds (logarithm of the odds) of the event happening.
The log-odds are then transformed into a probability using the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function).

Binary Dependent Variable:
In binary logistic regression, there is a single binary dependent variable (coded as 0 or 1).
Independent variables can be binary (two classes) or continuous (real values).

Applications:
Logistic regression is widely used for tasks like spam detection, disease diagnosis, and more.
It’s not just a classifier itself but can be used to create one by choosing a cutoff probability value.
Remember, logistic regression doesn’t perform statistical classification directly; it models probabilities.'''
